        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>My name is Tarık Buğrahan Dikkaya, you can call me as what as you want. I'm 17 years old. I've always wanted to be an engineer because 
            of my interest in electronics, computer and software. I've always enjoyed to learn new things since I was born. I'm also interested in music, 
            I am playing the Turkish instrument called bağlama since I was 6 years old. I worked on some projects about machine learning and electronics.
